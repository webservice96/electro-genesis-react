									We have extensive experience evaluating
									biological targets in multiple disease
									areas. Our team will ensure that an assay is
									optimized by evaluating multiple biomarkers
									and assay conditions, while using the most
									appropriate platform. Assays then undergo
									stringent validation and QA processes to
									ensure the assay is robust, provides
									accurate results, and is reproducible across
									multiple instruments and our global (US, EU,
									Asia-Pacific, and China) laboratories. Our
									utilization of fresh patient samples (within
									hours of sample collection) for validation
									provides us with a unique advantage to
									assess sample stability from Day 0. These
									samples are also instrumental in better
									understanding the performance of the assay,
									which may not be apparent with cell lines or
									other contrived samples.

									We have a proven track record validating and
									utilizing our assays for multiple Phase 3
									registrational trials. Hematogenix has also
									co-developed several assays as a companion
									diagnostic.
