								The use of NGS has ushered in a new era of
								precision oncology, and Workflow 24 employs this
								advanced technology to understand a tumorâ€™s
								molecular characteristics in order to improve
								patient classification and predict patient
								response to targeted therapy. The scientific
								experts at Workflow 24 have validated multiple
								NGS assays to cover AML, MDS, and other
								hematological disorders. Additionally, the
								Workflow 24 Bioinformatics team has developed
								proprietary analysis pipelines to harness the
								vast data provided by NGS.
