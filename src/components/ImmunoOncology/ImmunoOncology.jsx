								<p>
									Our understanding of the innate and adaptive
									immune responses has led to the development
									of key therapies in the fight against
									cancer. Specifically, cancer immunotherapy
									focuses on activation of the immune system
									to recognize and kill cancer cells. Some of
									the immunotherapies currently being adopted
									in clinical trials include targeting of
									inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-L1 and
									CTLA4), utilizing bi-specific antibodies,
									and incorporating adoptive cell transfers
									(e.g., Chimeric Antigenic Receptor (CAR) T
									Cells). As biopharmaceutical companies
									continue to design and develop
									immunotherapies, the need to assess the
									efficacies of these therapies grows. The
									HematogenixÂ® clinical, scientific and
									project management teams serve our biopharma
									partners as they advance these therapies.
								</p>
								<p>
									Hematogenix has been, and continues to be,
									involved in several clinical trials
									monitoring key biomarkers, such as PD-L1 and
									BCMA, and changes to the immune response
									during these trials. The BCMA IHC assay has
									been validated on FFPE tissue blocks,
									including decalcified bone marrow core
									biopsies as a single stain and as a dual
									stain with other biomarkers such as CD138.
									Multiple BCMA flow cytometry assays have
									also been validated on bone marrow aspirate,
									alone or as part of a broader multiple
									myeloma minimal residual disease (MRD)
									panel.

									Hematogenix is also one of the leading
									global facilities for PD-L1 IHC testing,
									utilizing all major PD-L1 clones (Ventana
									SP263, Ventana SP142, Dako 22C3, Dako 28-8
									and Dako 73-10) for diagnostics, clinical
									trials, and reproducibility studies.
									Multiple diagnostic PD-L1 tests are being
									used to understand how PD-L1 expression
									predicts responses to therapies. It is vital
									to compare these assays through concordance
									studies in various indications. Through
									collaborations with major pharmaceutical
									companies, we have published concordance
									studies on commercially available PD-L1
									clones in respected peer reviewed journals,
									in an effort to provide insight to
									harmonization of the PD-L1 diagnostic
									assays. Hematogenix also provides additional
									comprehensive assays by flow cytometry to
									assess the immune response, with targeted
									focus on PD-L1 in multiple disease types.
								</p>
								<p>
									As immunotherapies continue to develop,
									Hematogenix continues to grow with the
									field. We currently provide services for
									CAR-T cell clinical trials and look forward
									to providing this service for new and
									upcoming trials.
