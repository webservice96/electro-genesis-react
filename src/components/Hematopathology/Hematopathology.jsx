										Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
									</strong>{" "}
									is a group of diseases of the bone marrow
									and is considered one of the most difficult
									hematological disorders to characterize due
									to its complex and heterogeneous nature.
									Hematogenixâ€™s experienced hematopathologists
									are adept at interpreting AML, reviewing
									thousands of cases annually. AML testing is
									performed at Hematogenix by flow cytometry,
									molecular genetics, histology, FISH, and
									cytogenetics. We have validated multiple
									flow cytometry assays for immunophenotyping,
									receptor occupancy,and minimal/measurable
									residual disease (MRD) detection for AML.

									Our AML MRD flow assay is in alignment with
									the guidelines set forth by the European

									validated a highly-sensitive, comprehensive,
									73-gene myeloid panel for AML MRD detection
									by NGS. These assays are available at all of
									our locations (US, EU, Asia-Pacific, and
									China) and have been used for multiple phase
									3 registrational clinical trials, with
									single-subject reports provided to the sites
